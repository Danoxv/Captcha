# Captcha

##Captcha for checking a user for a bot

Requirements
PHP version >= 7.4+
Apache 2.4
How it works
The user enters what is shown in the picture with minor interferences (lines, ellipses, dashed lines).
If what is shown in the picture is poorly visible, 
then it follows the manual further and a new captcha of better quality is generated
